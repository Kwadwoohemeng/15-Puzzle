# 15 Puzzle

The puzzle is a 4 x 4 grid which starts out with the numbers 1-15 in it's first 15
cells and it's last cell blank. Clicking the Reset button at any time will return the
puzzle to this state. Clicking the Scramble button will (somewhat randomly)
rearrange the numbers in the grid. The user solves the puzzle by moving the
numbers back into the starting position, one at a time. This is done by clicking a
number adjacent to the blank square. This will cause the selected cell and the
blank cell to change places. In this manner the player can rearrange the cells in
the grid. When the cells are moved back into their original positions (ie. the
puzzle is solved), the grid turns Yellow (or some other color of your choice) to
indicate that the puzzle is solved.
